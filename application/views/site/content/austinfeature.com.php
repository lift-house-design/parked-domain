	<h1>Home Buying: A crash course</h1>
	Recently my husband and I navigated our way through the home buying experience. Being novice home buyers, we anticipated a fairly simple and straightforward process. This task quickly became a much lengthier project, and went something like this.....
	<h3>Credit </h3>
	We both have a pretty good credit history. Minus the years spent recovering from college loans, we have always been conservative spenders. So why did we need to obtain our specific credit score? As it turns out, obtaining our credit score would be the foundation for this “house of a project”! 
	<h3>Financing</h3>
	Now that we had our credit scores, we were able to receive accurate mortgage rates. We discovered tens of options available to us ranging from the traditional 20% down, to little to no down payment. But which option was the “right” option? As it turns out, there were not right or wrong options. Each option came with its own pros and cons. Additionally, we had overlooked several fees which would influence our decision: closing costs, attorney fees, appraisal fees, inspection fees, etc(not to mention the costs of remodeling or furniture). Needless to say, we utilized an experienced home loan expert to help us better understand all of our loan options, closing costs, and other fees.
	<h3>Lenders and Real Estate Agents</h3>
	Once again, there are many options out there. The best advice we received was to “shop around”. Our goal was to find the professionals that made us feel at ease, and confident throughout the decision making process. After talking to three Lenders, and three Real Estate Agents, we felt confident in our selections. 
	<h3>Pre-Approval</h3>
	Equipped with our credit scores, we decided it was best to receive pre-approval. Pre-approval gave us a better idea of the size loan that we qualified for. Once we obtained that information, we decided to go one step further and become approved for our desired loan amount. This made us, as home buyers, look more desirable to home sellers, as our financing was guaranteed.
	<h3>Find a Home</h3>
	...and we thought this would be the first step! Now that we had our finances in order we were able to begin our search. For us, the biggest challenge was finding a home with both the right square footage, and the right number of bedrooms and bathrooms. Our other must-have’s included a small backyard, quick commute to work, and convenient local shopping. 
	<h3>Make an offer</h3>
	As most home buyers experience, there is always a bit of haggling at this point. Most home sellers price their home a bit high. A good rule of thumb is to offer 5% below asking price. It is also beneficial to get a list of selling prices for comparable homes. Once the selling point was agreed upon, we quickly made an earnest money deposit, which went into escrow. We were getting closer!
 	<h3>Mortgage</h3>
	Adjustable rate, fixed rate, and interest-only......oh the options! But what does it all mean? After some investigation we decided that because we like predictable payments, and had planned on living in our new home long term, a fixed rate mortgage was right for us. Whenever we can, we are planning on adding $100/month to our mortgage payment. As it turns out, this will save us about $30,000 over the life of the mortgage. 
	<h3>Home Inspection</h3>
	The final steps in our home buying experience included completing a Home Inspection and agreeing on a closing date. Having a Home Inspection completed provided us peace of mind about our purchase. Although our real estate agent suggested a list of six home inspectors, we insisted that our Realtor post an inspection request at www.locizzle.com. Locizzle.com is a bidding platform that Realtors use to keep the process transparent, competitive, and efficient. 
We selected a fantastic home inspector. He found several small things that should be taken care of before we moved in. We were able to negotiate with the home seller, saving us $1,500. After ensuring that our investment was sound, our closing day was set....July 1st!     
	<h3>Preparing for Closing</h3>
	So, we had a fixed date and the clock was ticking. We had a lot to do. This is where your Realtor earns their commission. Remember the Realtor gets their commission after closing, so it makes sense that they should help. Ask your Realtor for a checklist of all the things you’ll need for closing. 
	<h3>Insurance </h3>
	Buying a home is a great time to review all your insurance needs. “Why?”, you ask. Simple, when you buy a home your financial picture changes. Not just paying the mortgage, but other things you’re responsible for should something go wrong. For example, your dog bites the neighbors child.. twice! The average dog bite claim is somewhere around $40,000. Ouch. So schedule a day to meet with three different insurance agents that represent a number of insurance providers. Consider buying packages including both home and auto. You can save big money! Also take a look at adding to your term life policy. But, remember that your mortgage provider may require that you buy an extra policy to cover your mortgage payments.
	<h3>Moving Day</h3>
	It had finally come! With only an apartment full of possessions, and family willing to help out, we did not need professional movers.The only thing left was to unpack, and purchase additional home furnishings. Throughout our home buying experience, we gained invaluable knowledge. Upon reflection, selecting the right professionals to work with made all the difference. Key for us was our choice of Real Estate Agent, Home Inspector and Insurance Agent. Having professionals working for you as the Home Buyer makes this lengthy process much less daunting.
